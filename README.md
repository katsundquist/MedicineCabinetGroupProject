"# MedicineCabinetGroupProject" 

The portion I worked on is the "Regimen" entity, DAO and menu.  One student laid out all the foundation work building the packages and creating the database.  
Another student was in charge of the "User" entity, DAO, and menu, and another student was in charge of the "Medicine" entity, DAO, and menu.

Unfortunately, half of our team did not complete the project and those pieces remain incomplete.  I am working on coding the rest of the project to have a complete
working program.
